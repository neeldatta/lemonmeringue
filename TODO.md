## Potentials for Instagram Integration

## **Instagram Graph API: Key Capabilities**

The main things we can do with the Instagram Graph API (for business/creator accounts):

### **Content & Media**

- **Get user profile info** (username, bio, profile pic, etc.)
- **Get user’s media** (images, videos, carousels, reels)
- **Get media details** (caption, media type, URL, timestamp, etc.)
- **Publish new media** (images, videos, carousels)
- **Delete media** (remove posts)

### **Engagement**

- **Get comments on media**
- **Reply to comments**
- **Delete comments**
- **Get likes on media**
- **Get like count on comments** (not direct, but you can get like count for media)
- **Get list of users who liked a media**

### **Insights & Analytics**

- **Get insights for media** (impressions, reach, engagement, saves, etc.)
- **Get insights for account** (follower count, profile views, etc.)

### **User Relationships**

- **Get list of followers** (limited)
- **Get list of users the account follows** (limited)
- **Mention/tag users in captions**

### **Webhooks**

- **Subscribe to real-time updates** (new comments, new media, etc.)

## **How Can You Combine These with LemonMeringue?**

### **Input Sources for Video Generation**

- Use **captions** of posts as prompts
- Use **comments** (filtered by likes, pins, or keywords) as prompts
- Use **images/videos** from posts as input media
- Use **profile info** (bio, username) for personalized content

### **Automated Engagement**

- Auto-generate and post a video in response to a comment
- Auto-reply to comments with a generated video
- Create “chains” of posts that reference each other (e.g., a story arc)
- Generate a video summary of the week’s most-liked comments or posts

### **Analytics-Driven Content**

- Generate content based on what’s trending in your own insights (e.g., most engaging topics)
- Post a “thank you” video when you hit a follower milestone

### **Community Features**

- Run contests: “Best comment gets a video reply”
- Let followers vote (via likes) on which comment should be turned into a video
- Feature top fans in generated content

### **Cross-Platform**

- Use Instagram content as input, but post the result to other platforms (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)

## **Other Packages/Tools You’ll Likely Need**

- **requests** or **httpx** (for REST API calls)
- **facebook-sdk** or **instagram-graph-api** (optional, for easier auth)
- **aiohttp** (if you want async)
- **pandas** or **sqlite3** (if you want to store/fetch data for analytics)
- **dotenv** (for managing API keys/tokens)
- **Flask/FastAPI** (if you want to set up webhooks for real-time updates)
- **OAuth libraries** (for user authentication flows)

## **Next Steps**

1. **Decide which features to prioritize** (auto-replies, analytics, contests, etc.)
2. **Design the API surface** (what methods/classes will you expose?)
3. **Plan authentication/token management** (how will users connect their IG accounts?)
4. **Sketch out a test script for Instagram integration**
